# Cortado

An epub reader that was started in HackGT 2018 and still needs some work to become a production application. 

There are a couple goals with this application: 
* To successfully convert pdf's to epub's.
* To work as a modern cross-platform epub reader. 
* To be really fast and lightweight. 

## Getting Started
This application attempted to use an express server to convert pdfs to epubs. All the code for the frontend lives inside the `/client` folder and uses yarn as a package manager while the global repo uses npm.

In order to get started running the code inside this application you'll need:
* Node
* Express
* React
* Yarn

Once you pull the repo and have everything else installed, run `npm install` from the root. After that you can cd into the `/client` and run `yarn`. After this you should have all you need to use the scripts in both `package.json`'s.

To run the electron app:
1. `cd client`
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start` 

If you run into any issues, open up and issue and I'll see what I can do!
